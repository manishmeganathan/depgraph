A Go Implementation for a simple dependency graph with circular resolution

### Overview
This package provides a simple implementation for a dependency graph with `DependencyGraph` into which edges and vertices can
be inserted, removed, checked for inclusivity, and iterated upon. It supports circular dependency resolution and deep fetching 
of dependencies. `DependencyGraph` can also be serialized into JSON, YAML, and POLO formats and implements the `engineio.DepDriver` interface for `go-moi`

### Installation
```
go get github.com/manishmeganathan/depgraph
```

### Notes:
This package is still a work in progress and can be heavily extended for a lot of different use cases.
If you are using this package and need some new functionality, please open an issue or a pull request.
